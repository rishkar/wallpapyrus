This python program essentially takes a subreddit and a timefilter (month, week, etc), grabs the top image and sets it as your windows background. 

It is important to note that this is very much a work in progress and at the time of writing, is in no way a completed project. Technically the base things work, but a lot of QOL updates need to be made since I plan on making this a project that others could actually use (even though noone will) without difficulty, full fleshed with a GUI, config validation, and potentially a central endpoint that the app contacts to download images and the like. But for now, this is what we have.
